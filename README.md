# How-other-NBA-statistics-affect-PPG
This project is about how other NBA player statistics such as FieldGoal%, EffectiveFieldGoal%, 2P%, 3P%, etc, effect the PPG (Points Per Game) statistic of individual players in the NBA. First I got familiar with the data and cleaned it in prepartion for the Linear Regression. I used Linear Regression to see how other stats would affect PPG, by building 3 different models all with different independent variables. With every model I drew a perfect regression line to visualize how each model performed. Unsurprisingly, FG% and eFG% had the highest postive effect with PPG, while PF (personal fouls), to my surprise, had the highest negative effect with PPG.
